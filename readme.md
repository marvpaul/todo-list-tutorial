# Simple TODO list
This is a repository for a small tutorial I've created on Youtube. It contains a simple todo list with localstorage persistence mechanics. 

The commits are structured like this:
1. Add basic html structure and styling 
2. Add and delete simple 
3. Local storage
4. More styling (adding Pico and Fontawesome)

5. Check / uncheck items
6. Unique ID for every DOM element
